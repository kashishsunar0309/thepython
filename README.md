# Python Crash Course (3rd Edition) Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and practice code from **Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition** by Eric Matthes.  
It’s part of my journey learning Python step by step.

## Contents
- Working with lists (names, cars, guest list)
- Using f-strings for greetings
- Practicing "python basic"
- Building small scripts to reinforce concepts

## Goals
- Strengthen my Python fundamentals
- Practice clean code and GitHub workflows
- Document my progress for future projects

## Notes
These exercises are based on the book examples, but the code here reflects my own practice and modifications.
